# Switching Screens #

With MinimOSD-Extra, you have 3 different screens you can use.

Screen 1 and 2 can show any panels.
Screen 3 is OSD off state.

## Screen 1 ##

Screen 1 is your primary screen.
It means your most important data should be on screen 1 as warnings make screen 1 to show up.

## Screen 2 ##

This is your secondary screen.

less critical data should be shown here.

If warnings are enabled MinimOSD-Extra will let you know if something is wrong even with data not shown on your screen 2, and will bring you back to screen 1.

## OSD off screen ##

All panels are off.

If warnings are enabled MinimOSD-Extra will let you know if something is wrong, by turning OSD on automatically and bringing you back to screen 1. So you can enjoy the view without worry. :)
